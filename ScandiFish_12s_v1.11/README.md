379 of 525* Scandinavian fish species are found in the database*

30 non-unique sequences

53 different species shares â‰¥1 sequence with other species

Marks:

*The species found in the Scandinavian databases do not use a common taxonomic classification for fish species and contain some sub-species. The species are then controlled against Catalogue of Life(COL) through FishBase which is a standard for classification. Then the species name obtained from Catalogue of Life is used to search for sequences in NCBI's Genbank which is using another classification than COL. We discovered that some species, especially Swedish Coregonus species found in the Scandinavian databases are not accepted in NCBI's classification, while accepted in COL. This results in an inflated number of non-found fish species, n=54. The same goes with rare species which have been observed a few times and are often registered in the Scandinavian databases but not in NCBI. This is the case for several deepwater species such as Lycodes and Careproctus species.
