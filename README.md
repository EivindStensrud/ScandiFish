## ScandiFish
The database is a collaborative work between Stensrud E., TÃ¶pel M. and Eiler A. as a part of Stensrud's master thesis.

ScandiFish is a metabarcoding reference database for the Scandinavian fish community.
The database is based on the MiFish-U primers, which amplify a hypervariable region of (~180bp) of the mitochondrial 12s rRNA region.
For more information for the primer check out the articles listed in suggested reading.
Fish species found present in November 2020 in www.artsdatabanken.no/, https://www.artdatabanken.se/, www.naturbasen.dk were extracted and offical latin names were obtained through FishBase(link) which uses COL taxanomy https://www.catalogueoflife.org/.

The first update (09.11.2021) contained 379 fish species with a total of 


The build-up of the database is based on sequence similarity using BLAST, this allows for sequences not annotated belonging to the 12s rRNA region to be analyzed.
Further is the database based on a non-linear pipeline, which saves already analysed accesion numbers which allows for faster and less labour intensive updates in the future.
